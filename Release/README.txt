The packet reader program is used to read CCSDS packets from binary files generated by the LunaH FSW.

The executable asks for the name of a binary file without the file extension (.bin). Type in the name of the file that is to be read in and parsed. The program does not care about case, but spacing and other characters must be correct.

The output of the program is two files: 

L2_packets_read.txt
L2_packets_raw_vals.txt

These two files will contain information about the packets as they were parsed including the packet size and the APID of the packet. The first file, "packets read", contains a longer text description of the packets which were processed, but the second file contains just the APID of each packet read, in the order they were read.

As the packets get more complex, this program will evolve to handle the increased information that must be scanned from the files. In the meantime, by knowing what the macro to generate the packets is, one can check the output of the FSW against what is expected by processing the output with this program. 

Between each run of the program, it writes what file it was processing so that a user doesn't have to worry about creating many files.
